## **Project Overview**

**BAAL KAVACH** is an IoT-based child safety and monitoring solution designed to empower parents with real-time tracking and emergency alert capabilities for their children. The device leverages GPS and GSM modules embedded within an ESP32 microcontroller system to provide reliable location updates and SOS alerting. Two physical device enclosures address different age groups: a tamper-resistant screw-mounted box for young children and a discreet portable variant for older kids.

The system transcends smartphone limitations by offering:

- Real-time GPS tracking with fallback to GSM cell tower triangulation.
- SOS emergency triggers via a dedicated button with immediate calling and alerting.
- Geofencing capability to notify when children stray beyond safe zones.
- Battery monitoring with warning alerts for low power.
- Secure, easy-to-access parental dashboard built on MERN stack for live tracking, location history, and emergency management.
