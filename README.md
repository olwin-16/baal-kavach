## **Project Overview**

BAAL KAVACH is an IoT-based child safety and monitoring solution designed to empower parents with real-time tracking and emergency alert capabilities for their children. The device leverages GPS and GSM modules embedded within an ESP32 microcontroller system to provide reliable location updates and SOS alerting. Two physical device enclosures address different age groups: a tamper-resistant screw-mounted box for young children and a discreet portable variant for older kids.
